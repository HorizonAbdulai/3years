                <h1>Year 3 Breakthroughs</h1>
                <p>This year was different. It was the first time I really felt like a developer. We shifted into web development,
                which I had never touched before. Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript gave me a whole new view on what programming could be.
                It was fun but also stressful at times trying to make things look and work the way I imagined.
                </p>

                <h1>Real Projects</h1>
                <p>This website you're on right now is actually part of my Year 3 work. I built it from scratch and made
                all the code myself. I never thought I’d be able to make a full website, but here I am.
                I also worked on a weather app using an API and a personal to-do list web app that I still use sometimes.

                    <h1>Biggest Changes</h1>
                    <div class="content-wrapper">
                        <p>I think the biggest change this year wasn’t just in my skill, but my mindset. I finally felt like this stuff could
                        actually be part of my future, even if I don’t do it professionally. I understand how websites work, how to make stuff interactive,
                        and how to fix my own mistakes. I stopped being afraid of bugs and started seeing them as part of the process.

                <h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
                <p>This year brought everything together for me. All the stuff I learned in Year 1 and Year 2 finally made more sense.
                I was writing full programs, building UI, and connecting things together. It still isn’t always easy, but
                I can actually enjoy the hard parts now. That’s how I know I’ve grown.
