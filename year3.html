                <h1>Year 3 Overview</h1>
                <p>
                    My third year was by far the most challenging and rewarding. I learned HTML, which I really enjoyed
                </p>
                <p>
                    This year pushed me to think bigger and apply what I learned in real-world projects like when my brother needed help with a website. It was sometimes frustrating but mostly exciting.

                        <p>
                            Ms. Pathan was my main teacher this year and really helped me understand HTML syntax and programming.
                            I worked on projects like simple websites, some complex but it was fun!.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One project that I was really proud of was a group project I had with Khalid and Michael, it was about SDG 16.10 and it was fun!

                <p>
                    By the end of Year 3, I gained confidence in making websites.
                    I also improved my ability to research challenges and find solutions online.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My goal moving forward is to continue improving my skills, possibly explore college courses in computer science,
                    and maybe develop some professional websites on my own.
