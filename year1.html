            <h1>Year 1 Overview</h1>
            <p>
                My first year in programming was a mix of excitement and challenges. I started with the basics and slowly built a foundation.
            </p>

            <h1>Engineering Class Fun</h1>
            <p>
                I also took an engineering class with Ms. Oâ€™Neil that was really fun. It had a similar hands-on approach as programming, and I enjoyed designing and building projects there too.
            </p>

            <h1>Early Projects</h1>
            <p>
                My first programming projects were simple, but they taught me important concepts like logic and syntax.

                <h1>Mr. Horston - Programming Teacher</h1>
                <div class="content-wrapper">
                  <p>Mr. Horston was my first programming teacher and he was really chill. He had a calm vibe and let us figure stuff out on our own. He was there when we needed help, but he also gave us space to explore and mess up, which I think helped me learn more. Our first major project was a basic calculator, and I remember struggling hard with the logic, but once I figured it out, it felt amazing. </p>

                    <h1>Challenges Faced</h1>
                    <p>
                        At first, coding logic was confusing, but practicing daily made things clearer. I learned to debug by trial and error, which was frustrating but rewarding.

            <h1>Mr. Dal - Second Teacher</h1>
          <p>Later in the year, we got our teacher switched to Mr. Dal. His energy was a lot different, more serious and focused. He pushed us harder, but that also helped me learn better. He helped me clean up my code and get better at writing stuff that actually made sense. </p>

            <h1>Calculator Project</h1>
            <p>
                One of my favorite assignments was learning replit. It was simple but showed me how to  use the things we learned.
