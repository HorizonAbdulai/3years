                <h1>Year 1 Overview</h1>
                <p>This is my first year in programming. I started learning the basics, and there were challenges and lots of fun!
                We mainly used Python during this year. It was weird at first because I didn’t understand the logic behind the code.
                But as time went on, I slowly started getting it. I learned about loops, if statements, variables, and simple games like rock paper scissors.

                <h1>Engineering w/ Ms. O’Neil</h1>
                <p>I also had an engineering class this year with Ms. O’Neil, and honestly, that class made me realize I liked problem-solving.
                We did a lot of hands-on projects that kind of reminded me of programming because it was all about figuring things out piece by piece.
                Ms. O’Neil made the class fun and engaging, and it gave me more confidence in learning tech stuff.

                    <h1>Mr. Horston</h1>
                    <div class="content-wrapper">
                        <p>Mr. Horston was my first programming teacher and he was really chill. He had a calm vibe and let us figure stuff out on our own.
                        He was there when we needed help, but he also gave us space to explore and mess up, which I think helped me learn more.
                        Our first major project was a basic calculator, and I remember struggling hard with the logic, but once I figured it out, it felt amazing.

                <h1>Mr. Dal</h1>
                <p>Later in the year, we got introduced to Mr. Dal. His energy was a lot different, more serious and focused. He pushed us harder,
                but that also helped me learn better. He helped me clean up my code and get better at writing stuff that actually made sense.
                I made a small text-based RPG game in his class and it was one of my favorite projects that year.
