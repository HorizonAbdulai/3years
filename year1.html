                <h1>Year 1 Overview</h1>
                <p>
                    This is my first year in programming. I started learning the basics, and there were challenges and lots of fun! I also took an engineering class taught by Ms. Oâ€™Neil,
                    which was a very fun class with a similar hands-on and problem-solving premise as my programming class.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Engineering class taught me to think practically about how things work, and programming showed me how to think logically to create solutions. Both classes helped me build a strong foundation.

                    <div class="content-wrapper">
                        <p>
                            Mr. Horston was my first programming teacher. He introduced me to the very basics of coding, such as variables, loops, and simple functions.
                            At first, I struggled with concepts like syntax and debugging, but with his patient teaching, I gradually understood how to think like a programmer.

                        <p>
                            One of my first projects was creating a basic calculator program, which helped me see how logic flows and how to organize code.
                            That project gave me confidence to keep learning more complex things.

                <h1>Mr. Dal</h1>
                <p>
                    Mr. Dal also taught me during this first year and helped me with more applied programming tasks.
                    He encouraged me to think critically and helped me debug problems when I got stuck.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One project I worked on with Mr. Dal was building a simple calculator app. It was challenging but rewarding to see it work after debugging.
