                <p>
                    Throughout all my high school years, I've taken programming classes and in this website I'll explain to you
                    the ups and downs, struggles, and fun I've had throughout the years!
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'll make sure to go into the specifics about how much fun I had in the other
                    parts of the website, however, in general I would say that I definitely had fun!
                    My years in programming have been full of learning new things and applying them, which
                    gives me a sense of satisfaction, especially this year!

                        <p>
                            Hey! My name is Abdulai Bayoh. I'm 17 years old and I created this website to record the details
                            of the things I've gone through all throughout my 3 years of learning programming
                            at Horizon Science Academy! First thing you should know about me is that I'm a pretty
                            slow learner, so the things that I will show you truly do show how good my teachers
                            were and how dedicated they were to teach me things.
                        </p>

                            <h1>How I've Grown</h1>
                            <p>
                                Throughout these years, I've improved a lot and not just technically, but in how I solve problems and work through challenges.
                                Each mistake helped me learn something new, and every successful program gave me confidence and motivation to keep going.
                                This journey has shaped the way I think and tackle real-world problems.

                <h1>Why Programming?</h1>
                <p>
                    To be honest, I didn't really have a choice... It wasn't my decision. However, I feel as though it was
                    a great choice that was made for me.
                </p>
                <h1>Any Regrets?</h1>
                <p>
                    Even though I'm not sure if I'll choose to pursue programming at a collegiate level. I definitely
                    don't have any regrets. My teachers have all taught me well and treated me even better throughout
                    my years. Respect to all of them.
                </p>
