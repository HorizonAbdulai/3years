            <h1>All About My Journey</h1>
            <p>
                Throughout all my high school years, I've taken programming classes, and this website shares the ups and downs, struggles, and fun I've had along the way!
            </p>

            <h1>Did I Have Fun?</h1>
            <p>
                I’ll explain more about the fun parts in other pages, but overall, programming has been exciting and rewarding. Learning new concepts and applying them gave me satisfaction, especially this year.
            </p>

            <h1>What I’ve Learned</h1>
            <p>
                I gained skills in problem-solving, debugging, and designing projects. Each year brought new challenges that helped me grow both technically and personally.

                        Hey! I’m Abdulai Bayoh, 17 years old, and this site records my 3-year programming journey at Horizon Science Academy. I’m a slow learner, so my progress reflects the amazing support and teaching from my instructors.

                        <h1>How I've Grown</h1>
                        <p>
                            I've improved a lot—not just technically but in how I approach problems. Every mistake was a lesson, and every success boosted my confidence. This journey has changed how I think about challenges.

            <h1>Why Programming?</h1>
            <p>
                Honestly, programming wasn’t my choice at first, but it turned out to be a great path. It opened doors I didn’t expect.
            </p>

            <h1>Any Regrets?</h1>
            <p>
                I’m not sure if I’ll study programming in college, but I don’t regret a thing. My teachers were great and supported me all the way. Respect to all of them.
            </p>
