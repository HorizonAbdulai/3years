            <h1>Year 2 Overview</h1>
            <p>
                Year 2 was about diving deeper into programming, learning JavaScript, and starting to build interactive applications.
            </p>

            <h1>New Challenges</h1>
            <p>
                Learning JavaScript was tough at first. Understanding event-driven programming and DOM manipulation took time, but I enjoyed the process.
            </p>

            <h1>Expanding Skills</h1>
            <p>
                I worked on more complex projects like to-do lists and simple games, which helped me see how programming can create real-world apps.

                <div class="content-wrapper">
                    <p>
                        Mr. Dal guided us through the basics of JavaScript and helped us understand key concepts like functions, arrays, and loops.

                    <h1>Projects and Practice</h1>
                    <p>
                        I built projects like a simple to-do app that allowed me to practice handling user inputs and data dynamically.
                    </p>

            <h1>What I Learned</h1>
            <p>
                JavaScript was challenging but rewarding. I found it exciting to add interactivity to websites and make my programs respond to users.
            </p>

            <h1>Favorite Project</h1>
            <p>
                The to-do app was my favorite because it was practical and helped me understand how apps store and update information.
