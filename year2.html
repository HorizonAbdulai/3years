                <h1>Year 2 Overview</h1>
                <p>
                    My second year was full of new challenges and growth. I got to dive deeper into programming with JavaScript, which introduced me to dynamic web programming and more complex concepts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This year also tested my patience and determination, but I discovered that solving tricky problems is rewarding. I also explored data structures and how to organize data efficiently.

                            Mr. Dal was my main teacher in Year 2, guiding me through JavaScript basics to intermediate projects.
                            Learning JavaScript was initially confusing because it is quite different from the languages I had learned before, but I gradually got the hang of it.

                        <p>
                            One project I enjoyed was building a to-do list app, which helped me understand event handling, user inputs, and DOM manipulation.
                            I felt proud seeing my app work in real-time and be useful.

                <h1>What I Learned</h1>
                <p>
                    This year I mainly learned about JavaScript. It was sort of challenging, but nothing good ever comes easy! I honestly
                    enjoyed what I learned. At first, I would say that I didn't enjoy learning JavaScript, but I did have fun throughout the process and
                    I believe that it's something that may come back to help me in the future!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond coding, I learned the importance of breaking down big problems into smaller parts and testing code regularly.
                    These skills made me more confident in handling programming challenges.
