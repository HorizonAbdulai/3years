                <h1>Year 2 Highlights</h1>
                <p>This year was when I really started to understand how coding worked. We still worked with Python,
                but we started using more advanced stuff like file handling and functions inside of functions.
                I also started to care more about how my code looked, not just if it worked. Mr. Dal had high expectations,
                and I wanted to live up to that.

                <h1>Working with Others</h1>
                <p>One of the coolest things about this year was doing more group work. I used to be kind of quiet in class,
                but working in groups helped me open up a little. We did a mini "create your own tool" project where
                I worked with a partner to make a basic file organizer. It helped me get used to collaborating and sharing code.

                    <div class="content-wrapper">
                        <p>I felt like I started to actually think like a programmer this year. I was catching my own bugs,
                        writing cleaner code, and even helping some of my classmates figure stuff out. It made me realize I wasn’t
                        that same confused freshman from Year 1. My confidence grew a lot during this time and I wasn’t as afraid of new problems.

                <h1>Favorite Projects</h1>
                <p>I had a few fun projects this year, but my favorite was this text-based puzzle game I made where users had
                to input clues to escape a digital “room.” It took me a few weeks and I restarted it like 3 times, but it came out great.
                I also did a password manager that saved data to files, which felt really advanced for me at the time.
