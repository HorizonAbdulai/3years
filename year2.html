            <h1>Year 2 Overview</h1>
            <p>
                Year 2 was about diving deeper into programming, learning JavaScript, and starting new things.
            </p>

            <h1>New Challenges</h1>
            <p>
                Learning JavaScript was tough at first. Understanding the different things about it was difficult, but since we used replit I was sort of acquianted with it, so I enjoyed the process.
            </p>

            <h1>Expanding Skills</h1>
            <p>
                I worked on more complex projects and learned more about how JavaScript works, thanks to Mr. Dal I currently know more than I think I would know, this year definitely prepared me for my third class; Ms. Pathan's

                <h1>Mr. Dal - Instructor</h1>
                <div class="content-wrapper">
                    <p>
                        Mr. Dal guided us through the basics of JavaScript and helped us understand key concepts like functions, arrays, and loops. (I sort of forgot them now but he did teach us!)
                    </p>

                    <h1>Projects and Practice</h1>
                    <p>
                        We also did a lot of app lab in that class, which was essentially part of a website that would allow us to use code building blocks to make websites or apps for mobile devices. I remember I had an app that was a quiz about geometry, fun!

            <h1>What I Learned</h1>
            <p>
                JavaScript was challenging but rewarding. I found it exciting to add interactivity to websites and make my programs respond to users.
            </p>

            <h1>Favorite Project</h1>
            <p>
                The app was my favorite because it was practical and helped me understand how apps fundementally work.
